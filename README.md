Project Overview
​This project is a straightforward simulation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It was built using fundamental programming principles to demonstrate how core concepts like control flow, game state management, and user interaction can be applied in a practical environment. The project aims to be both a learning and a functional application.
​Features
​Customizable Rounds: The user can specify the number of rounds to play.
​Randomized Opponent: The computer makes random choices, providing an unpredictable gameplay experience.
​Score Tracking: The system accurately tracks the wins for both the player and the computer, as well as draw outcomes.
​Final Winner Declaration: After all rounds are completed, the game declares a definitive winner based on the total score.
​Modular Design: The code is structured into functions to ensure readability, maintainability, and reusability.
​Technologies Used
​C++ (Core language).
​Procedural Programming.
​Random Number Generation.
​Basic Data Structures (such as struct).
​Learning Goals
​This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
​Designing and implementing user-driven applications.
​Handling data structures for managing game state.
​Applying simple algorithms for decision-making.
​Organizing code in a clean and modular way.
​Problem-solving and debugging.EnterPProject Overview
